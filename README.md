MythTV backend
==============

Docker image to run a MythTV backend. It also includes database backups and HDHomeRun utils.
All special MythTV folders (as setup in mythtv-setup) should be added to /home/mythtv. 
The mythdatabase branch/tag should be run side-by-side with master/latest branch/tag. It will run the cron job to check and backup your mythtv database.
The setup branch/tag is intended to run mythtv-setup over RDP. This should be run instead of the master/latest branch/tag, during setup only. 
A MythWeb branch/tag is to come.
Note that this container does not include a MySQL or MariaDB database. You must set up a database before (no need to create the mythconverg database as it is automatically created if it does not exist).

## Usage

Launch the container via docker:
```
sudo docker run -d --name mythbackend \
        -p "5000:5000" -p "6543:6543" -p "6544:6544" \
        -v "/path/to/mythtv-home:/home/mythtv" \
        -v "/path/to/mythtv-backups:/var/lib/mythtv/db_backups" \
        -e "USER_ID=1001" \
        -e "GROUP_ID=1001" \
        -e "DATABASE_HOST=dbhost" \
        -e "DATABASE_PORT=3306" \
        -e "DATABASE_ROOT=root" \
        -e "DATABASE_ROOT_PWD=rootpassword" \
        -e "DATABASE_USER=mythtv" \
        -e "DATABASE_PWD=mythtv" \
        -e "TZ=Europe/Paris" \
        -h mythbackend \
        --network="host" \
        dheaps/mythbackend:latest &&
        
sudo docker run -d --name mythdatabase \
        -e "USER_ID=1001" \
        -e "GROUP_ID=1001" \
        -e "DATABASE_HOST=dbhost" \
        -e "DATABASE_PORT=3306" \
        -e "DATABASE_ROOT=root" \
        -e "DATABASE_ROOT_PWD=rootpassword" \
        -e "DATABASE_USER=mythtv" \
        -e "DATABASE_PWD=mythtv" \
        -e "TZ=Europe/Paris" \
		 dheaps/mythbackend:mythdatabase
```

Below are some remarks about the parameters.

## Ports

* Port 5000/udp is used for UPNP
* Port 6543 and 6544 are used by MythTV (API and web GUI)

## Volumes

* /mnt/recordings can be used to store recordings (configure MythTV to point to this folder)
* /mnt/video can be used to store videos (configure MythTV to point to this folder)
* /home/mythtv is mainly useful to persist the .mythtv folder where configuration is stored like connection to the database
* /var/lib/mythtv/db_backups will hold backups of the database that are generated weekly by MythTV

## Environment variables

* USER_ID and GROUP_ID : used to match IDs defined on the Docker host so that UNIX rights are correct when accessing the volumes
* DATABASE_HOST and DATABASE_PORT : the host (and port) where the mythconverg database is. If the database exists it is untouched, if not it is created
* DATABASE_ROOT and DATABASE_ROOT_PWD : credentials used to create the database if needed
* DATABASE_USER and DATABASE_PWD : credentials used check if mysql is up and wait otherwise; and to create config as necessary 
* TZ : to set the correct timezone

## Network parameters

* hostname (-h) : MythTV uses a hostname to match the parameters in the database so it is better (almost mandatory) to define your own hostname than to use the hash generated by Docker. This is the "hostname" of the container. My advice is to NOT choose the same name as the Docker host or a name of another computer on your network (be creative !).
* host network option (--network="host") : this option is not mentioned in other MythTV docker images on Docker Hub but my tests showed that without it the web GUI is not accessible and a frontend cannot connect to the backend (an error appears in the log saying the connection to the backend was lost).
